This was a project for my Big Data Analytics class. The assignment was to identify three zip codes that provide potential profitable investment opportunities.

We used time series forecasting using Facebook's Prophet package for this analysis.

In addition to the Zillow data, I used a few data sources from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (average salary, number of employed people, and number of business establishments time series data for every zip code in the country over the last 20 years). 

The full code, explanations, and documentation is in the Jupyter Notebook file, and HTML copy is here as well for download.
